# Covid-19-and-Happy-Countries
Analysis to see relationship between Covid-19 and happy, developed countries.

Objective: An interesting analysis to see any relationship between Covid-19 and happy,developed countries.

Three datasets used:

1.COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.

2.World happiness dataset

3. Covid 19 deaths dataset.

Modules imported
pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

Insights:
People who live in developed countries are more prone to get the infection with comparison to the less developed countries.
But,this might be due to lack of corona test kits in the less developed countries.
Hence the same analysis was done using the covid deaths datasets and world happiness dataset and got the same results.
